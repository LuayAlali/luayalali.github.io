		<p class="context-desc">One day, I was trying to find my way through the mall by using the navigational diagram near the entrance.  I realized everyone, including myself, who tried to use the diagram left confused and unsure.  It did not have a clear indicator of where we were in the mall, which direction we were facing, nor were the stores clearly labelled.  Instead, we had to utilize an index of a list of stores on the side and reference it with a code of sort on the map.
